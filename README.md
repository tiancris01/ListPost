### Project Description
<p>In this project retrieve some user data in JSON format from API service and using that data I created a Flutter ListView. To create a ListView we use ListView.builder class. By clicking the ListView item it opens a new window and shows all user details on that screen.

Also, you can add post favourited by taping the star icon therefore all favourite post can be reached in the Favorite Screen by taping in the star icon located in the AppBar.

There are 2 more buttons one is the FloatingActionButton wich allows you to clean the post list, and the refresh button also located in the AppBar which refreshes the app by getting all the posts back.

I tried to use some Clean Architecture but this is just a simple app with SetState as a State Management I can always improve it using Provider, BloC or other State Management

Additionally, by creating this project you can have some idea about how to use the ListTitle widget and Url Launcher.</p>
